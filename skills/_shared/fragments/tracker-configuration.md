## Tracker Configuration

Every tracker op runs through the tracker CLI, `TRACKER=<skill-dir>/../coding-crew-lib/scripts/tracker/cli.mjs` (`<skill-dir>` being the
directory you read this file from), as `node "$TRACKER" <op> …`; nothing else reads or writes the tracker. Before the
first op run `node "$TRACKER" config` (prints `tracker=<kind>` and `configured=yes|no`). On `configured=no` on an
interactive run, invoke the `configure-tracker` skill, then continue; on a non-interactive run (a headless/`-p`
invocation or a subagent) never ask: proceed as `local`. The tracker's refs, statuses and labels are in
`<skill-dir>/../coding-crew-lib/scripts/tracker/docs/<kind>.md`.

Exit codes, every op: 0 ok; 3 not found; on 1 (the op failed) or 2 (a usage error or an invalid ref), report the
stderr verbatim, fix its cause (an input, auth, the network) and re-run the op, never performing it with the tracker's
own tool. `publish-issues` adds 4 and 5, which the skill that publishes handles.
